description: I published my first article about Kubernetes in a tech magazine
---

Big news! After some hard weeks and endless hours of writing, re-writing and re-re-writing my colleague Andreas and I finally finished our first article about Kubernetes called _"Einf√ºhrung in Kubernetes"_ (engl. Introduction to Kubernetes). I am particularly proud that our article is the cover story of the new magazine.

So today is the official release of the latest [Entwickler Magazin][entwickler-de] about Kubernetes and container orchestration. Entwickler Magazin is a german magazine dedicated to developers, architects and projectleads of any kind and is released on a two-monthly basis in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

I would like to provide you with some reading samples, but unfortunately I am not allowed to do so at the moment. As soon as there are some official excerpts available I'll update this post. But if you are looking for a simple and understandable _"Introduction to Kubernetes"_ you are in good hands with the magazine. On almost 10 pages you will learn the basics and be introduced with a clearly arranged information graphic. Also included is a small demo for a specific use case. So that you also know what you should look out for in your newsstand, here is a picture of the cover.
