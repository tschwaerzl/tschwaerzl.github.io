This is a private blog hosted by the wonderful people of [GitHub.com][github]. Mostly I write about tech related stuff but you'll see every now and then random rants about random stuff - so please bear with me.

If you'd like to get in touch with me just hit me a message [@tschwaerzl][twitter-ts] or meet me at a local [MeetUp about OpenShift, Kubernetes and Docker][meetup-grp]. I'd be happy to meet you soon.
